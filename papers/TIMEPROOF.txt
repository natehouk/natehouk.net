\section{Formal Analysis of the TimeProof Function}
In this section we derive the verification function used in the protocol. Assuming proof revelation follows a Poisson process, the probability that no proof is submitted by time \(\Delta t\) is 
\[
e^{-\lambda \Delta t}.
\]
Thus, the probability that a valid proof is submitted (i.e. verified) by time \(\Delta t\) is:
\[
V(\Delta t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}.
\]

\subsection{Game-Theoretic Implications and Strategic Withholding Risks}
The TimeProof protocol employs economic incentives to motivate prompt proof submission. Let \(R_0\) be the maximum reward available. A delaying participant incurs a decay in the reward modeled by
\[
R(\Delta t) = R_0 \cdot e^{-\gamma \Delta t},
\]
where \(\gamma\) is the decay constant. This incentive structure is designed so that the Nash equilibrium is achieved when all rational participants submit their proofs promptly, thereby mitigating risks associated with strategic withholding.

\section{Conclusion}
This section has provided the formal analytical foundation for the TimeProof function and highlighted its game-theoretic underpinnings. Future work will include empirical evaluation and simulation of the protocol.
