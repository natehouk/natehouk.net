I am not mad.

P=NP is true.

What follows is a non-constructive proof of such. There, however, does not exist a constructive proof. Therefore an efficient computational method is impossible within the real 4-dimensional universe.

P=NP!=MAD is true.
P=NP=MAD is also true.

Therefore MAD!=MAD.

The MAD paradox can be observed in nature, i.e. the MAD doctrine is unstable on an infinite timeline.

Therefore P=NP.

Q.E.D. @nature @numberphile

While P=NP is provable non-constructively within M-theory, an efficient method will most likely never be found given a finite N dimensions. Due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, as argued by Stephen Hawking in “Gödel and the end of physics,” it is most likely N is infinite. (http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/events/strings02/dirac/hawking/)

Solving the MAD paradox would lead to a constructive proof. Stated another way, the MAD paradox is unsolvable within a finite number N dimensions. Being solvable within N finite dimensions leads to the principle of explosion within N dimensions. Therefore, N is most likely unbounded i.e. the multiverse is infinite.
